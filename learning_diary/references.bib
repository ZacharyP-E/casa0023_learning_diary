  abstract = {Accurate prediction of crop yield before harvest is critical to food security and importation. The calculated ten explanatory factors and autumn crop yield data were used as data sources in this research. Firstly, a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was employed to carry out explanatory factors and feature selection. The simple effects of RDA were used to evaluate the interpretation rates of the explanatory factors. The conditional effects of RDA were adopted to select the features of the explanatory factors. Then, the autumn crop yield was divided into the training set and testing set with an 80/20 ratio, using Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and deep neural network (DNN) for the model, respectively. Finally, the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the performance of the model comprehensively. The results showed that the interpretation rates of the explanatory factors ranged from 54.3\% to 85.0\% (p = 0.002), which could reflect the autumn crop yields well. When a small number of sample training data (e.g., 80 samples) was used, the DNN model performed better than both SVR and RF models.}

  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) technologies provide a diagnostic tool that can serve as an early warning system, allowing the agricultural community to intervene early on to counter potential problems before they spread widely and negatively impact crop productivity. With the recent advancements in sensor technologies, data management and data analytics, currently, several RS options are available to the agricultural community. However, the agricultural sector is yet to implement RS technologies fully due to knowledge gaps on their sufficiency, appropriateness and techno-economic feasibilities. This study reviewed the literature between 2000 to 2019 that focused on the application of RS technologies in production agriculture, ranging from field preparation, planting, and in-season applications to harvesting, with the objective of contributing to the scientific understanding on the potential for RS technologies to support decision-making within different production stages. We found an increasing trend in the use of RS technologies in agricultural production over the past 20 years, with a sharp increase in applications of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) after 2015. The largest number of scientific papers related to UASs originated from Europe (34\%), followed by the United States (20\%) and China (11\%). Most of the prior RS studies have focused on soil moisture and in-season crop health monitoring, and less in areas such as soil compaction, subsurface drainage, and crop grain quality monitoring. In summary, the literature highlighted that RS technologies can be used to support site-specific management decisions at various stages of crop production, helping to optimize crop production while addressing environmental quality, profitability, and sustainability.},

Due to the characteristics of large-scale and dynamic observation, remote sensing technology has been an indispensable approach for environmental monitoring. This paper reviews the satellite resources, institutions and policies for environmental monitoring in China, and the advances in research and application of remote sensing from five aspects: ecological index retrieval, environmental monitoring in protected areas, rural areas, urban areas and mining areas. The remote sensing models and methods for various types of environmental monitoring, and the specific applications in China are comprehensively summarized. This paper also points out major challenges existing at the current stage: satellite sensor problems, integrated use challenges of datasets, uncertainty in the retrieval process of ecological variables, scaling effect problems, a low degree of automation, the weak ability of forecasting and comprehensive analysis, and a lack of computational power for massive datasets. Finally, the development trend and future directions are put forward to direct the research and application of environmental monitoring and protection in the new era.},

Due to the important ecosystem services, and the natural resources this forest provides, in Mexico, it has become increasingly necessary to use new technologies and tools to support the planning, implementation, and integration of forest management and conservation plans, as well as ecological and socioeconomic analysis of this ecosystem. Remote Sensing techniques and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been a true technological and methodological revolution in the acquisition, management and analysis of geographic information. A case study of a land cover change analysis performed on the Mexican Water Forest from 1990 to 2010 is described as an example of an actual application of remote sensing and GIS technologies, and to show how these technologies can be used to improve forest management in the region. As a result, I identified nine challenges of managing the Water Forest, along with their corresponding solutions provided by the use and application of remote sensing techniques as key tools in the management and conservation of the Mexican Water Forest. Based on these results, I propose recommendations on how remote sensing and GIS tools can be used to create adequate forest management plans in this region.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) data acquired by satellite have wide scope for agricultural applications owing to their synoptic and repetitive coverage. On the one hand, spectral indices deduced from visible and near-infrared RS data have been extensively used for crop characterization, biomass estimation and crop yield monitoring and forecasting. On the other hand, extensive research has been conducted using agrometerological models to estimate soil moisture to produce indicators of plant-water stress. This paper reports the development of an operational spectro-agrometeorological yield model for maize using a spectral index, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from SPOT-VEGETATION, meteorological data obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) model and crop-water status indicators estimated by the Crop Specific Water Balance model (CSWB). Official figures produced by the Government of Kenya (GoK) on crop yield, area planted and production were used in the model. The statistical multiple regression linear model has been developed for six large maize-growing provinces in Kenya. The spectro-agrometerological yield model was validated by comparing the predicted province-level yields with those estimated by GoK. The performance of the NDVI and land cover weighted NDVI (CNDVI) on the yield model was tested. Using CNDVI instead of NDVI in the model reduces 26\% of the unknown variance. Of the output indicators of the CSWB model, the actual evapotranspiration (ETA) performs best. CNDVI and ETA in the model explain 83\% of the maize crop yield variance with a root square mean error (RMSE) of 0.3298 t/ha. Very encouraging results were obtained when the Jack-knife re-sampling technique was applied proving the validity of the forecast capability of the model (r2= 0.81 and RMSE= 0.359 t/ha). The optimal prediction capability of the independent variables is 20 days and 30 days for the short and long maize crop cycles respectively. The national maize production during the first crop season for the years 1998 to 2003 was estimated with a RMSE of 185 060 tons and coefficient of variation of 9 \%.},

Understanding the dynamics associated with wildfire, such as risks, spatial distribution, and effects is important for developing a clear understanding of its ecological influences. Remote sensing technologies provide a means to study fire ecology at multiple scales using an efficient and quantitative method. This paper provides a broad review of the applications of remote sensing techniques in fire ecology. Remote sensing applications related to fire risk mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, burned area estimates, burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery monitoring are discussed. Emphasis is given to the roles of multispectral sensors, lidar, and emerging UAS technologies in mapping, analyzing, and monitoring various environmental properties related to fire activity. Examples of current and past research are provided, and future research trends are discussed. In general, remote sensing technologies provide a low-cost, multi-temporal means for conducting local, regional, and global-scale fire ecology research, and current research is rapidly evolving with the introduction of new technologies and techniques which are increasing accuracy and efficiency. Future research is anticipated to continue to build upon emerging technologies, improve current methods, and integrate novel approaches to analysis and classification.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have evolved rapidly over the past decade driven primarily by military uses, and have begun finding application among civilian users for earth sensing reconnaissance and scientific data collection purposes. Among UAS, promising characteristics are long flight duration, improved mission safety, flight repeatability due to improving autopilots, and reduced operational costs when compared to manned aircraft. The potential advantages of an unmanned platform, however, depend on many factors, such as aircraft, sensor types, mission objectives, and the current UAS regulatory requirements for operations of the particular platform. The regulations concerning UAS operation are still in the early development stages and currently present significant barriers to entry for scientific users. In this article we describe a variety of platforms, as well as sensor capabilities, and identify advantages of each as relevant to the demands of users in the scientific research sector. We also briefly discuss the current state of regulations affecting UAS operations, with the purpose of informing the scientific community about this developing technology whose potential for revolutionizing natural science observations is similar to those transformations that GIS and GPS brought to the community two decades ago.},

In this study, the multi-layer root zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy.},
