    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing refers to techniques used to gather data for an object or area of interest without directly measuring it. This often makes use of sensors aboard satellites or aircraft (Li et al. 2020; Watts, Ambrosia, and Hinkley 2012), but can also employ handheld measurements such as LIDAR (Dong and Chen 2017).\nThis has become an important tool for environmental research due to the large amounts of data becoming available, with relatively high temporal resolution.\n\n1.1.1 How do they work?\nRemote sensors measure electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from a study area. This energy originates from the sun, the sensor itself, or even man-made lights.\nThe workflow of the sensor can be seen below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Broad Classifications\nSensors can be broken down into two broad classes, being passive and active.\n\n\nFigure 1: Broad classifications of remote sensors.\n\n\nImage Source: Lopez Ornelas (2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\nPassive\n\n\n\nEnergy Source\nEmits electromagnetic waves from sensor.\nUses reflected energy from the sun\n\n\nBenefit\n\nCan penetrate through clouds, and vegetation.\nControl of sensor leads to highly accurate data.\n\n\nCheaper and requiring less specialised hardware compared to Active sensors.\nWider range of wavelengths providing a more comprehensive view.\n\n\n\nLimitation\n\nMore expensive than passive sensors due to the required energy source.\nThe emitted radiation can impact upon wildlife.\n\n\nLess effective during poor weather conditions.\nSuffers from shadow effects from vegetation (E.g. trees), soil and buildings.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic (EM) waves\nThe EM energy measured by the sensor is not equal to that which is emitted by the source. This is due interferences such as energy absorption on a surface, or scattering from particles within the atmosphere.\nThe different wavelength of the EM radiation interacts with surfaces in different ways, making some ideal for remotely sensing planetary surfaces (not limited to Earth observation).\n\n\nFigure 2: Strength of reflection from surfaces\n\n\nImage Source: Young and Onoda (2017)\n\n1.1.4 Resolution\nThe level of detail is referred to as resolution. Remotely sensed data features four forms of resolution (similar to the resolution of a camera).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial\nTemporal\nSpectral\nRadiometric\n\n\n\nDescription\nThe unit area that a single pixel spans.\nThe time between usable successive images (revisit time).\nThe number of electromagnetic wave bands in an image.\nThe number of bits representing the digitised waves. |\n\n\nImportance\nProviding more detailed data on study area.\nAbility to identify change through time.\nAllows more detailed information on properties of the study area.\nIdentifying finer variations in reflected energy.\n\n\nUnits\nFeet or meters squared.\nDays\nWavelength or band\nBits"

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nThe ability of satellites to revisit the same point on earth every 16 days, allows for an extensive list of applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Szpakowski and Jensen 2019)\nMany academic studies use remotely sensed data to quantify changes temporally.\n\nFlood and drought assessment\n\nSAR data can be used to identify water surface anomalies, allowing the identification of flooding or drought over large spatial extents. Lopez et al. (2020) used data to calculate the surface water areal fraction (SWAF) of the Amazon river basin to quantify changes in water content after the drought in 2010.\n\n\nFigure 3: Changes in SWAF in the Amazon basin during a drought event in 2010.\n\n\nCASA’s own Ollie Ballinger is at the forefront of remote sensing application innovation. Specifically within the intelligence gathering stream.\n\nRadar Interference Tracker (Ballinger 2022)\n\n\nAccidentally maximizing (instead of minimising) the background noise of the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery revealed interference caused by active missile defense systems spread across the middle east. Allowing those with the technical skills to manipulate remotely sensed data to identify locations of the armed forces activity. This phenomena has been found to occur due to the overlap of wavelength frequencies between military radar systems and that used by SAR satellites.\n\n\nFigure 4: Converging lines of interference over an Airbase in Bahrain.\n\n\nImage Source: Dan (2020)\n\nOpen Source Damage Detection in Ukraine\n\nTopography data (likely from SAR satellite sensor) was used by Ollie to identify variation before and after an event, allowing the quantification of building height change. This can be overlaid with OSM (Open Street Map) data to allow the prediction of quantity of residents displaced by the distraction during conflict, in addition to starting to identify where resources should be allocated best to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure."

    "text": "8.2 Urban Heat Island\nSurface temperatures in urban areas are higher than their rural counterparts, due to the high density of infrastructure that can absorb heat efficiently and dissipates it poorly. This can be seen in Figure 8.1.\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Temperature differences between urban and rural areas.\n\n\nImage Source: “Urban Heat Island | World Meteorological Organization” (n.d.)\n\n8.2.0.1 Importance\nThe substantial effects that UHI’s have on energy consumption, public health, biodiversity, and the economy are well documented (Guo et al. 2020). Unfortunately, it is also known that positive feedback loops are linked with the UHI effect, as can be seen in the diagram below (authors’ own).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis feedback loop becomes harder to exit as time goes by due to two key factors:\n\n\nIncreased inertia: To change the trajectory of the feedback loop a significant amount of energy is required.\n\nThresholds: Small changes over a critical threshold have been found to produce substantial increases in urban surface temperatures.\n\nThe impacts of UHI’s can be broken down into three subsections, present within Table 8.1\n\n\nTable 8.1: Table of the UHI effect’s possible impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nExample\n\n\n\nSocial\n1500 annual addition fatalities in the US attributed to UHI (Hsu et al. 2021).\n\n\nEnvironmental\nIncreased use of fossil fuels by 550m tons each year across the US (Roxon, Ulm, and Pellenq 2020).\n\n\nEconomic\nMelbourne estimated $282m (AUD) UHI-related health costs (Whiteoak and Saigar, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.0.2 Causes\nThe UHI effect has a combination of factors contributing to it (also seen in Figure 8.2):\n\n\nHuman Activities: Transportation, air conditioning and construction generate high levels of pollutants and heat.\n\nAlbedo: The reflectivity of urban infrastructure is lower, meaning energy (heat) is absorbed.\n\nReduced Vegetation Cover: Trees and vegetation can provide shade, allowing the dissipation of heat.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Causes of the UHI effect. Image Source: (Nuruzzaman 2015)\n\n\n\n8.2.0.3 Mitigation strategies\nCurrent policy documents addressing the UHI effect are not fit for purpose. The UN’s ‘beating the heat’ handbook for city officials is 208 pages long and has received extensive criticism:\n\n\nLack of focus:  The focus was largely on developing countries, criticism suggested more help was needed for different urban contexts.\n\nLimited concrete action: Not enough guidance was given for action (or even methods to implement them) that can be taken to mitigate UHI effects.\n\nVarious cities are implementing their strategies with different rates of success, as seen in Table 8.2.\n\n\nTable 8.2: Table of the cities’ mitigation policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity\nMitigation Policy\nWas it successful?\n\n\n\nBarcelona\nSuperblocks\nYes, but no supporting scientific literature.

    "text": "8.3 Application\nMacLachlan et al. (2021) worked to justify the integration of modelling UHI effects in urban planning. This work could be taken further with the combination or collaboration with Richter et al. (2021). This work identified the impact tree species had on surface temperature by implementing a remote sensing workflow. The study revealed a 1◦C difference in mean land surface temperatures between the warmest and coldest tree species, reaching 4◦C in the most extreme cases. The researchers suggest that remote sensing is certainly a feasible and effective methodology for monitoring surface temperature in urban environments while providing key insights into the cooling potential of various tree species.\nHowever, while both studies suggest that land surface temperature can be effectively and efficiently remotely sensed, there may be some limitations to their approaches. A key limitation is the limited spatial resolution of remotely sensed data, which is likely not high enough to make this scalable in a cost-effective manner. Of course, thermal imagery can be collected by UAVs providing a much higher resolution, but this will come with increased costs.\nA limitation specifically to Richter et al. (2021) is the lack of addressing atmospheric conditions, which have been reported to have substantial impacts upon satellite-derived temperature data. Lastly, the focus on one study area makes the research less generalisable so may not be applicable to other regions."

    "text": "8.4 Reflection\nIt is evident that top-down policy suggestions, like “Beating the Heat”, are largely ineffective at mitigating the effects of the UHI effect. I understand the need for a comprehensive framework on which cities can base their policy, but in this case, the document should focus on real-world applications of policy. Another factor to consider is that a policy that is effective in one city potentially won’t work for another, due to variations in land use and weather patterns. Therefore, I believe that local-level governance would be more effective at implementing strategies tailored to their individual urban contexts. Though, this of course comes with limitations in terms of increased costs.\nOne large takeaway is the necessity that modelling is becoming to identify methods in which to reduce and monitor the state of UHI’s effects on various cities. This will hopefully allow the prediction and prevention of further increases in unnecessary mortality.\nPositive feedback loops are of great interest to me.

This compares the quantity of correct and incorrect (misclassification) classifications. An example of which can be seen in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Classification Error Matrix. Image Source: Barsi et al. (2018)\n\n\nAccuracy can then be broken down into:\n\nProducer’s Accuracy: The percentage of correctly defined samples within a classification compared to the ground truth.\nUser’s Accuracy:  The percentage of correctly defined samples compared to other classifications.\nOverall Accuracy: The percentage of all correctly defined samples.\n\nAccuracy is required to ensure the usefulness of classification results in remote sensing applications, as inaccurate models may make decision-makers uninformed. It is important to identify a suitable balance between the accuracy measures, as focusing on one may lead to placing too much importance on identifying unusual classes at the cost of overall accuracy.\nThis is related to a phenomenon known as overfitting (demonstrated in Figure 7.2). This leads to high performance in training datasets, but otherwise, it performs poorly. This means that the model has learned the noise of the dataset, rather than the general trends occurring.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Identifying a balance between accuracy measures ensures an appropriate level of the fitting. Image Source: GeeksForGeeks (2017)\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve\nThis is a graphical representation of classification model performance showing the relationship between True and False positive rates (TPR & FPR). The ROC curve maps a perfect classifier against the TPR and FPR values to allow simultaneous evaluation of multiple classification models, as can be seen in Figure 7.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: ROC curve. Image source: MartinThoma (2018)\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Spatial Cross Validaiton\nSpatial cross-validation is a technique used to account for Tobler’s first law of geography (spatial autocorrelation) and ensure assumptions of validation techniques are maintained, particularly referencing the independence of data.\nThe method can be seen in Figure 7.4. Nearby pixels are not considered due to their increased likelihood to be similar (possibly biasing the model). The data is iteratively partitioned into training sets allowing validation data to be spatially independent, which is crucial for assessing the model’s accuracy.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Identifying spatial cross validaiton.

(2020) used a random forest approach with Sentinel 2 imagery to compare reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices. Cross-validation was undertaken to evaluate the mapping accuracy across the study area, revealing >95% accuracy for unburnt and extreme severity classes, with a drop off to 70% for moderate classes. The authors suggest that further study is required to improve the classification accuracy of low and moderate-severity classes and apply the RF algorithm to hazard-reduction fires.\nHowever, again the study lacks a comparison to existing fire severity mapping methods in addition to only features only sources of satellite imagery. To mitigate these research credibility risks the author should consider comparing with other data sources to evaluate the relative benefits and weaknesses of the current model, and where possible even integrate further data sources such as thermal imagery."

It was interesting to learn just how powerful classification techniques can be when paired with remote-sensing data, with the valuable information to be had regarding patterns and characteristics of planetary surfaces. However, to produce reliable and accurate classifications it is important not to blindly apply them to data. To do this one must understand both the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and choose accordingly based on the specific application.

    "text": "6.1 Summary\nWeek 6 focused on the use of classification techniques within remotely sensed data, with some use cases looking at illegal logging identified by the Brazilian polices force to have a near real-time response to new bouts of activity.\nThe classification techniques included involve:\n\nLinear regression\nClassification and regression trees (CART)\nWith a specific look into the limitations such as overfitting involved.\nRandom forests can be used to skirt these downfalls with multiple iterations.\n\nAnother group sees unsupervised learning.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nHowever, the use of these methods should be thought over due to the resemblance to a black box.\nClassification techniques are an integral stage required to efficiently process and analyse remotely sensed data, due to the sheer volume of images acquired. Pixels are grouped with their neighbours based on their spectral characteristics, allowing both spatial and temporal analysis of trends.\nSupervised classification refers to the use of training a model on existing data, allowing the algorithm to learn the characteristics attributable to various land cover types. This can then be applied to unseen data accurately and reliably. However, this technique comes with a high initial cost for creating the training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs)\n\n\n\nSVMs are a linear binary classification technique that separates points with a boundary, called a ‘separating hyperplane’. This identifies the largest margin between the classes, allowing increased generalisation performance across the unseen data.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Support vector machines.\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised classification, on the other hand, is an approach that can be applied when there is limited knowledge of the area of study. This is often referred to as a clustering technique, where similar spectral values are grouped. After which, are interpreted by the user. These techniques benefit from not requiring prelabeled data. However, it can often be difficult to interpret the classes, due to the black box-like nature of the model (meaning it is not clear how the classes were separated).\nTo conclude, the efficient identification of reliable and accurate land use and cover types through time requires the use of classification techniques. Supervised and Unsupervised learning methods will be chosen based on their relative strengths and weaknesses."

    "text": "6.2 Application\nIn this section, one use of classification techniques in the real world is identified and relevant literature is reviewed.\nClassification techniques have a multitude of applications within remote sensing research, a key research topic being the prediction of crop yields. It provides stakeholders (farmers, academics and government officials) with an efficient and relatively accurate means to identify the yield of a field, therefore allowing informed decisions to be made. The work of both Dang et al. (2021), and Zhu, Wang, and Luo (2021) used Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to explain an average of 80% of the variation within their crop yields. This suggests that classification techniques could be of use to different scale groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\nSmall Scale\nLarge Scale\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nFarmers\nGovernments\n\n\nPossible uses 1\nAccess to finance: Financial institutions may provide more favourable terms on their loans with evidence of expected yields.\nImproved food security: Governments can plan for food droughts by taking appropriate measures during a year of low expected crop yields.\n\n\nPossible uses 2\nAccess to finance: Financial institutions may provide more favourable terms on their loans with evidence of expected yields.\nIncreased tax accuracy: Government GIS departments can compare reported yields from farmers to that predicted using classification techniques.\n\n\n\nThough there are extensive benefits to the semi-automation of crop yield prediction using remote sensing, caution should be had before adopting this methodology. Khanal et al. (2020) noted several criticisms of this methodology, including:\n\nThe limited spatial resolution could lead to missing key points of interest.\nPossible inaccurate sensor calibration leading to over/ underestimation of the yield\nExtensive data processing before insights can be extracted\n\nRojas (2007) proposed the use of ground validation to mitigate these limitations. As this would not only allow for more accurate modelling in the future but also more confidence to be had for the existing image sets.\nA summary of this section can be seen in Figure 6.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Summary meme.

This refers to the complex underlying algorithms behind the classification techniques often being difficult to understand leading to the little rationale behind decisions. This proves problematic in the fields of academia and informing policy, as we need to ensure that the methods are unbiased and not discriminatory. Furthermore, if applied without sufficient prior consideration the classification models may move from the realm of data-informed/ driven decision-making to data validation.

Water-specific atmospheric correction methods (SeaDAS and ACOLITE) have much greater reliability and accuracy. The two largest external contributors to errors were identified to be wind speed and solar zenith angle, as can be seen in Table 3.3.\n\n\nTable 3.3: Table of key errors identified in Ilori, Pahlevan, and Knudby (2019)’s research, and their reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsible factor\nReasoning\n\n\n\n\nSolar Zenith Angle (SZA)\nHigh SZAs lead to reductions in the concentration of light entering the atmosphere.\n\n\nWind Speed\nPrevlaining wind of high-speed causes waves to impact the surface roughness.

This becomes problematic when additional factors may be present in the ‘global South’ that should be considered. For example, Okafor-Yarwood and Adewumi (2020) identified that while developed nations tend to dispose of their waste through landfill, less developed countries can sometimes resort to dumping their waste into their oceans. This is likely to have a large impact on the remote sensing capabilities specifically when trying to map bathymetry.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Mapped location of validation sites for Ilori, Pahlevan, and Knudby (2019)’s research."
