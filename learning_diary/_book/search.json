    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing refers to techniques used to gather data for an object or area of interest without directly measuring it. This often makes use of sensors aboard satellites or aircraft (Li et al. 2020; Watts, Ambrosia, and Hinkley 2012), but can also employ handheld measurements such as LIDAR (Dong and Chen 2017).\nThis has become an important tool for environmental research due to the large amounts of data becoming available, with relatively high temporal resolution.\n\n1.1.1 How do they work?\nRemote sensors measure electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from a study area. This energy originates from the sun, the sensor itself, or even man-made lights.\nThe workflow of the sensor can be seen below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Broad Classifications\nSensors can be broken down into two broad classes, being passive and active.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Broad classifications of remote sensors.\n\n\nImage Source: Lopez Ornelas (2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\nPassive\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Source\nEmits electromagnetic waves from sensor.\nUses reflected energy from the sun\n\n\nBenefit\n\nCan penetrate through clouds, and vegetation.\nControl of sensor leads to highly accurate data.\n\n\nCheaper and requiring less specialised hardware compared to Active sensors.\nWider range of wavelengths providing a more comprehensive view.\n\n\n\nLimitation\n\nMore expensive than passive sensors due to the required energy source.\nThe emitted radiation can impact upon wildlife.\n\n\nLess effective during poor weather conditions.\nSuffers from shadow effects from vegetation (E.g. trees), soil and buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic (EM) waves\nThe EM energy measured by the sensor is not equal to that which is emitted by the source. This is due interferences such as energy absorption on a surface, or scattering from particles within the atmosphere.\nThe different wavelength of the EM radiation interacts with surfaces in different ways, making some ideal for remotely sensing planetary surfaces (not limited to Earth observation).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Strength of reflection from surfaces\n\n\nImage Source: Young and Onoda (2017)\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolution\nThe level of detail is referred to as resolution. Remotely sensed data features four forms of resolution (similar to the resolution of a camera).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial\nTemporal\nSpectral\nRadiometric\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThe unit area that a single pixel spans.\nThe time between usable successive images (revisit time).\nThe number of electromagnetic wave bands in an image.\nThe number of bits representing the digitised waves. |\n\n\nImportance\nProviding more detailed data on study area.\nAbility to identify change through time.\nAllows more detailed information on properties of the study area.\nIdentifying finer variations in reflected energy.\n\n\nUnits\nFeet or meters squared.\nDays\nWavelength or band\nBits"

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nThe ability of satellites to revisit the same point on earth every 16 days, allows for an extensive list of applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Szpakowski and Jensen 2019)\nMany academic studies use remotely sensed data to quantify changes temporally.\nSAR data can be used to identify water surface anomalies, allowing the identification of flooding or drought over large spatial extents. Lopez et al. (2020) used data to calculate the surface water areal fraction (SWAF) of the Amazon river basin to quantify changes in water content after the drought in 2010.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Changes in SWAF in the Amazon basin during a drought event in 2010.\n\n\nCASA’s own Ollie Ballinger is at the forefront of remote sensing application innovation. Specifically within the intelligence gathering stream.\n\nRadar Interference Tracker (Ballinger 2022)\n\nAccidentally maximizing (instead of minimising) the background noise of the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery revealed interference caused by active missile defense systems spread across the middle east. Allowing those with the technical skills to manipulate remotely sensed data to identify locations of the armed forces activity. This phenomena has been found to occur due to the overlap of wavelength frequencies between military radar systems and that used by SAR satellites.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Converging lines of interference over an Airbase in Bahrain.\n\n\nImage Source: Dan (2020)\n\nOpen Source Damage Detection in Ukraine\n\nTopography data (likely from SAR satellite sensor) was used by Ollie to identify variation before and after an event, allowing the quantification of building height change. This can be overlaid with OSM (Open Street Map) data to allow the prediction of quantity of residents displaced by the distraction during conflict, in addition to starting to identify where resources should be allocated best to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nThe use of passive remotely sensed data appears to have significant flaw of being obstructed by poor weather conditions with cloud cover, in addition to the limited spatial resolution.
