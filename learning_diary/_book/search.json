    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing refers to techniques used to gather data for an object or area of interest without directly measuring it. This often makes use of sensors aboard satellites or aircraft (Li et al. 2020; Watts, Ambrosia, and Hinkley 2012), but can also employ handheld measurements such as LIDAR (Dong and Chen 2017).\nThis has become an important tool for environmental research due to the large amounts of data becoming available, with relatively high temporal resolution.\n\n1.1.1 How do they work?\nRemote sensors measure electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected from a study area. This energy originates from the sun, the sensor itself, or even man-made lights.\nThe workflow of the sensor can be seen below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Broad Classifications\nSensors can be broken down into two broad classes, being passive and active.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Broad classifications of remote sensors.\n\n\nImage Source: Lopez Ornelas (2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\nPassive\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Source\nEmits electromagnetic waves from sensor.\nUses reflected energy from the sun\n\n\nBenefit\n\nCan penetrate through clouds, and vegetation.\nControl of sensor leads to highly accurate data.\n\n\nCheaper and requiring less specialised hardware compared to Active sensors.\nWider range of wavelengths providing a more comprehensive view.\n\n\n\nLimitation\n\nMore expensive than passive sensors due to the required energy source.\nThe emitted radiation can impact upon wildlife.\n\n\nLess effective during poor weather conditions.\nSuffers from shadow effects from vegetation (E.g. trees), soil and buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic (EM) waves\nThe EM energy measured by the sensor is not equal to that which is emitted by the source. This is due interferences such as energy absorption on a surface, or scattering from particles within the atmosphere.\nThe different wavelength of the EM radiation interacts with surfaces in different ways, making some ideal for remotely sensing planetary surfaces (not limited to Earth observation).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Strength of reflection from surfaces\n\n\nImage Source: Young and Onoda (2017)\n\n\n1.1.4 Resolution\nThe level of detail is referred to as resolution.

Lopez et al. (2020) used data to calculate the surface water areal fraction (SWAF) of the Amazon river basin to quantify changes in water content after the drought in 2010.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Changes in SWAF in the Amazon basin during a drought event in 2010.\n\n\nCASA’s own Ollie Ballinger is at the forefront of remote sensing application innovation. Specifically within the intelligence gathering stream.\n\nRadar Interference Tracker (Ballinger 2022)\n\nAccidentally maximizing (instead of minimising) the background noise of the Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery revealed interference caused by active missile defense systems spread across the middle east. Allowing those with the technical skills to manipulate remotely sensed data to identify locations of the armed forces activity. This phenomena has been found to occur due to the overlap of wavelength frequencies between military radar systems and that used by SAR satellites.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Converging lines of interference over an Airbase in Bahrain.\n\n\nImage Source: Dan (2020)\n\nOpen Source Damage Detection in Ukraine\n\nTopography data (likely from SAR satellite sensor) was used by Ollie to identify variation before and after an event, allowing the quantification of building height change. This can be overlaid with OSM (Open Street Map) data to allow the prediction of quantity of residents displaced by the distraction during conflict, in addition to starting to identify where resources should be allocated best to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure."

    "text": "6.1 Summary\nWeek 6 focused on the use of classification techniques within remotely sensed data, with some use cases looking at illegal logging identified by the Brazilian polices force to have a near real-time response to new bouts of activity.\nThe classification techniques included involve:\n\nLinear regression\nClassification and regression trees (CART)\nWith a specific look into the limitations such as overfitting involved.\nRandom forests can be used to skirt these downfalls with multiple iterations.\n\nAnother group sees unsupervised learning.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM)\n\nHowever, the use of these methods should be thought over due to the resemblance to a black box.\nClassification techniques are an integral stage required to efficiently process and analyse remotely sensed data, due to the sheer volume of images acquired. Pixels are grouped with their neighbours based on their spectral characteristics, allowing both spatial and temporal analysis of trends.\nSupervised classification refers to the use of training a model on existing data, allowing the algorithm to learn the characteristics attributable to various land cover types. This can then be applied to unseen data accurately and reliably. However, this technique comes with a high initial cost for creating the training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs)\n\n\n\nSVMs are a linear binary classification technique that separates points with a boundary, called a ‘separating hyperplane’. This identifies the largest margin between the classes, allowing increased generalisation performance across the unseen data.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Support vector machines.\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised classification, on the other hand, is an approach that can be applied when there is limited knowledge of the area of study. This is often referred to as a clustering technique, where similar spectral values are grouped. After which, are interpreted by the user. These techniques benefit from not requiring prelabeled data. However, it can often be difficult to interpret the classes, due to the black box-like nature of the model (meaning it is not clear how the classes were separated).\nTo conclude, the efficient identification of reliable and accurate land use and cover types through time requires the use of classification techniques. Supervised and Unsupervised learning methods will be chosen based on their relative strengths and weaknesses."

    "text": "6.2 Application\nIn this section, one use of classification techniques in the real world is identified and relevant literature is reviewed.\nClassification techniques have a multitude of applications within remote sensing research, a key research topic being the prediction of crop yields. It provides stakeholders (farmers, academics and government officials) with an efficient and relatively accurate means to identify the yield of a field, therefore allowing informed decisions to be made. The work of both Dang et al. (2021), and Zhu, Wang, and Luo (2021) used Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to explain an average of 80% of the variation within their crop yields. This suggests that classification techniques could be of use to different scale groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScale\nSmall Scale\nLarge Scale\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nFarmers\nGovernments\n\n\nPossible uses 1\nAccess to finance: Financial institutions may provide more favourable terms on their loans with evidence of expected yields.\nImproved food security: Governments can plan for food droughts by taking appropriate measures during a year of low expected crop yields.\n\n\nPossible uses 2\nAccess to finance: Financial institutions may provide more favourable terms on their loans with evidence of expected yields.\nIncreased tax accuracy: Government GIS departments can compare reported yields from farmers to that predicted using classification techniques.\n\n\n\nThough there are extensive benefits to the semi-automation of crop yield prediction using remote sensing, caution should be had before adopting this methodology. Khanal et al. (2020) noted several criticisms of this methodology, including:\n\nThe limited spatial resolution could lead to missing key points of interest.\nPossible inaccurate sensor calibration leading to over/ underestimation of the yield\nExtensive data processing before insights can be extracted\n\nRojas (2007) proposed the use of ground validation to mitigate these limitations. As this would not only allow for more accurate modelling in the future but also more confidence to be had for the existing image sets.\nA summary of this section can be seen in Figure 6.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Summary meme.
