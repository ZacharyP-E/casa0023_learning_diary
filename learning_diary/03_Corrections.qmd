# Remote Sensing Data

Week 3 focused on the processing involved in producing analysis ready data products from raw images.

## Summary

### Satellite Data Acquisition

There are two ways in which satellites collect remotely sensed data.

### Corrections

Due to natural variability corrections are used to remove the imapcts various factors have on collected images. This will give a more accurate view of the study area.

#### Geometric Correction

more needed

#### Atmospheric Correction

Removing the effects of atmospheric interference on imagery, to improve quality. Interference comes from the scattering of incoming light, and the absorption of that being reflected. Both of which can result in a poor representation of the study area.

Correction

#### Empirical Line Correction

Correcting for the non-uniform

more needed

#### Topographic (Orthorectification) Correction

Correcting for topographic features disrupting the reluctance values, as caused by shadows and slopes. By identifying the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) and the Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) the amount of illumination of the target area can be calculated, allowing essential correction to more accurately represent the study area.

#### Radiometric Correction

Adjusting the values of imagery to account for variation within the sensors sensitivity. Therefore, allowing for a more consistent account of the conditions being monitored within the study area.
